## ## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project is a full-cycle food delivery application inspired by platforms like Swiggy, Zomato, and Uber Eats. It features distinct interfaces and functionalities for three key user roles: customers, restaurant managers, and delivery agents.

The platform is built on the MERN stack and leverages **Socket.IO** for real-time communication, ensuring that order statuses, notifications, and location tracking are updated instantly across all clients. From browsing menus and placing orders to real-time delivery tracking on a map, this application provides a comprehensive and modern food ordering experience.
